  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Roisin O’Dowd and I am a sophomore at Pitt.  I am from Northeast Pennsylvania, in the Pocono Mountains,
    and I went to Stroudsburg High School.  I currently live in an apartment close to Pitt with two roommates, who are
    also both sophomores.  As of now, I am majoring in Molecular Biology, but I will probably be changing my major to
    Bioinformatics.  I think biology is the most interesting subject in the world, but computer science is awesome and
    I would love to take formal programming and theory courses.</br>
    I’m probably one of the few students studying biological sciences who isn’t pre-med,
    which means I get a lot of confused looks when I talk to people in my major since normally people would rather die
    than not be pre-med.  Not an exaggeration.  I’m very interested in public health and national security, so maybe
    one day I’ll be working for the CDC or NIH.  You’re probably wondering why I’m taking an engineering course.
    Well, I’m part of a program run through the Department of Homeland Security which has students take classes in
    STEM and security fields in exchange for a scholarship, hence why I’m probably also the only non-engineering major
    in this class.  What a time.

  <h2>Things I have Learned About College</h2>
    1) I thought that I would find other people passionate about their interests in college, and I did.
    2) I thought that partying would play a larger role in college, and I'm glad to find that at Pitt
    people have fun partying but they also have other interests and passions they care about more than getting drunk.
    3) I've learned that your classes and grades matter, but in most cases what you learn outside the classroom is far more
    valuable, both in finding jobs and in learning overall.  I think this is especially the case at Pitt, since not all classes
    are stellar, but the opportunities Pitt students have in the city of Pittsburgh are unparalled by those at other colleges.
