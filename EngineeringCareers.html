                <!-- General information on engineering -->

                <p align="left">There are so many different areas of engineering to work in; however, most engineers choose to specialise in just one, such as chemical, automotive or robotics. Careers in engineering are constantly evolving and new processes and technologies
                  are being developed all the time. This allows engineers to stay on the ball and react to new problems and challenges in their chosen field. Every industry and every area of society depends on the precise and efficient work of engineers.

                  <ol type="A" start="4">Types of Engineering:
                    <li>Mechanical</li>
                    <li>Chemical</li>
                    <li>Civil</li>
                    <li>Industrial</li>
                    <li>Computer</li>
                    <li>Biomedical</li>
                    <li>Nuclear</li>
                    <li>Petroleum</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <p>Engineering careers are constantly varied in terms of their job responsibilities, but also in their working locations. As an engineer you could be working in an office, in a laboratory, on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean, in a factory,
                  or even in outer space. Each engineering discipline requires professionals with very specific skill-sets. However, each and every area of this sector is as complex as the next. Consequently, all engineers need to have strong mathematical
                  skills, logic and the ability to rise to intellectual and practical challenges
                </p>

                <!-- Discusses my area of interest-->

                <h3><font color="orange">My Area of Interest: Bioengineering</font></h3>

                <p>We like to think of it as the application of engineering principles to biological systems. Bioengineering as a defined field is relatively new, although attempts to solve biological problems have persisted throughout history. Recently,
                  the practice of bioengineering has expanded beyond large-scale efforts like prosthetics and hospital equipment to include engineering at the molecular and cellular level â€“ with applications in energy and the environment as well as healthcare.

                <p>
                  A very broad area of study, bioengineering can include elements of electrical and mechanical engineering, computer science, materials, chemistry and biology. This breadth allows students and faculty to specialize in their areas of interest and collaborate
                  widely with researchers in allied fields.
