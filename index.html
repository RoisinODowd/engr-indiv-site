                <p>Hello, my name is Roisin O'Dowd and I am a sophomore at Pitt. I am from Northeast Pennsylvania, in the Pocono Mountains, and I went to Stroudsburg High School. I currently live in an apartment close to Pitt with two roommates, who are
                  also both sophomores. I think biology is the most interesting subject in the world, but I have recently started to play around with programming and I really enjoy it.</p>

                <p>So far I have tinkered around with backend webdev and a little bit of Android, and I am excited to learn about JavaScript in this course because I would like to try web design.</p>

                <p>You are probably wondering why I am taking an engineering course.</p>

                <p>Well, I am part of a program run through the Department of Homeland Security which has students take classes in STEM field, homeland security, and national preparedness in exchange for a scholarship, hence why I am probably the only non-engineering
                  student in this class. The Department of Homeland Security actually has a lot of jobs relating to biology, which I think is very interesting and not widely known. I have not figured out what I want to do with life, so in the meantime
                  I am making myself as competitive as possible. As well as national security, I am very interested in public health and national security, so maybe one day I will be working for the CDC or NIH.</p>
